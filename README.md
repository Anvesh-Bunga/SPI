The objective of this project is to implement the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol in a configuration where a single master communicates with two slave devices. The design ensures that the SPI master operates at a flexible speed relative to the input clock frequency and supports all four operational modes (0, 1, 2, and 3) to facilitate versatile and reliable data transfer.
